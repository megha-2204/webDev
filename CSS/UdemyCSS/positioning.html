<!-- Static Positioning: This is the default positioning for elements. 
 A static element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. 
 
 Fixed Positioning: This positions an element relative to the browser window. 
 It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.

 Relative Positioning: When an element is set to relative positioning, it is positioned relative to its normal position in the flow. 
 You can then adjust it using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

 Absolute Positioning: An absolutely positioned element is removed from the document flow and can be placed anywhere
within its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., an element that is relative, absolute, or fixed). 
 It is positioned with respect to its closest positioned ancestor.
