*Padding concepts*
What is padding?
-> defines the space between the content of an element and its border.
-> if an element has a height and width defined, adding padding will increase those dimensions since padding is added to the content area.

Margin
-> it creates space between divs
-> Margin is the space outside an element's border. It separates the element from other surrounding elements.

Outline:
-> An outline is a line drawn around the element's border, like a border

Border:
A border is the line that surrounds an element, this will be present at last after outline
